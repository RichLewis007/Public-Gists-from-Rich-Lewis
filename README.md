Daily‑refreshed list of my public GitHub gists.  
**Live:** https://github.richlewis007.com/Public-Gists-from-Rich-Lewis/

- **Site repo:** `Public-Gists-from-Rich-Lewis` (served from `/docs` via GitHub Pages)
- **Generator:** `Create-Gist-List` (GitHub Action runs daily at 9:00 AM ET)

### Documentation
- [Overview - high-level what/why/how](docs/OVERVIEW.md)
- [Architecture - technical details, paths, workflows, scopes](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Maintenance
- Do **not** edit `docs/index.md` by hand — it’s overwritten by the workflow.
- The generator also writes a copy to the repo root as `Public-Gists-by-Rich-Lewis.md`.
- Optional intro/outro: edit `docs/_header.md` and `docs/_footer.md` (if present).
